    "description": "Open-source software has a high barrier of entry due to source code disorganization, caused mainly by a lack of structured documentation. For this project, I will create a brief GitHub README file to depict an ideal version of the file and argue that the current state of OSS's documentation is not acceptable. OSS documentation must find a method of tracking and portraying project information that is universally accepted within the open-source community.",
