# Talking Docs

I am currently working to add audio files to the releases within Discography. The walkthroughs will answer W5H in an experimental documentation technique. 
The podcast-like approach hopes to reduce the friction point of using new software, either as a consumer or a developer, by offering a more digestible introduction to the system's purpose and history.

**Note:** Still working through the audio files, each project is filed in one take so as to reduce the friction added by this documentation style, but this means there will be an update to the UI of the Discography coming soon as well.
